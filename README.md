I've seen some YouTube videos where people made games on oscilloscopes. But
all those use "fancy" setups, like a digital scope with 2 beams and an FPGA to
generate the signals to drive it. So I set out to make a game using just my old
Knight Kit analog one-beam scope and a computer with a stereo sound card. This
is the result.

There are 2 versions of this. Asteroids-scope (the "real" version) draws
vector graphics and renders them to looping sound clips it plays. You need an
oscilloscope and stereo sound card to use this one. Asteroids-window (the "fake"
version) draws the exact same graphics, but renders them to a window on your
computer screen. It produces no sound. You don't need any additional hardware
to run it.

### NOTES ON IMAGE QUALITY / THOSE RAYS IN THE BACKGROUND

The faint rays flying around in the background are to help stabilize the picture
on old analog oscilloscopes. The game draws things by moving the scope's beam
around the screen. Since this is using a sound card and a not-fancy scope, it
can't turn off the beam. It *can* move it really fast so it doesn't leave much
of a trail though. After drawing every few objects, it moves the beam to a
random corner of the screen and draws a faint border around the screen before
moving it to the start of the next object. It does this up to 100 times a
second, resulting in lines in the background that change quickly. (They have to
change quickly because if the same faint line gets drawn over and over, it
becomes bright due to the phosphors in the scope's CRT.)

These rays are also visible in the windowed, non-oscilloscope version of the
program. The same code is running, and it doesn't know or care which of the two
graphics library backends is attached to it.

On a real scope, wiggles or zigzags are visible where the beam enters and leaves
some shapes. This is because the audio signal controlling it just made a big
jump. The small audio amps found in PC sound cards do this, and you can see it
if you play a square wave using the sound card and watch it on a scope, or
record it using an audio program that lets you zoom in on the wave. You *might*
get better results with a hi-fi amp connected via S/PDIF. (The S/PDIF part is
very important -- otherwise you're still feeding the hi-fi amp the inferior
original signal generated by the sound card's amp; S/PDIF is digital, so it
avoids this.)

The wiggles and zigzags shake too. This is because of the picture stabilizing
stuff above. If the stabilizer code always used the same screen corner, the
wiggles wouldn't move from one frame to the next. But then those faint rays
would get drawn over and over and be more visible. Also some shakiness helps
hide image defects, as can be seen on older analog TVs.


CONTROLS (either version)
=========================

At the title screen:

 * Space = start new game
 * M = cycle screen orientations/flips (if your scope or wiring is backwards)

During the game:

 * left/right arrows = spin ship left or right
 * up/down arrows = forward and reverse thrusters
 * space = cannon

When you die: (ship breaks up and vanishes)

 * R = respawn ship in the center of the screen (or in the middle of an
       asteroid, if that's what's in the center of the screen!)

Any time:

 * Q or ESCape = quit

Note that you have infinite lives in this game, and there's no on-screen score
indicator. This is to reduce the number of things on the scope screen. Otherwise
it would flicker even more than the title screen.

You can see your score on the console/terminal/stdout.txt whenever you die. 


OSCILLOSCOPE / HARDWARE SETUP (if you want to use the "real" version)
=====================================================================

System requirements:

 * Windows (win32), Linux or Mac OS X - see below
 * Stereo line-out or headphone jack on computer

Hardware and tools:

 * Oscilloscope that has an option for an external horizontal drive signal
     (It might be called something else. On my Knight KG-635, you set the
      "H. SELECTOR" knob to "EXT" on the far right of the "AMP" zone. Anyhow,
      it's *not* horizontal *sync*. That won't work - you'll see waveforms
      instead of a picture.)
 * Something you can chop a cord off of that has a 1/8" headphone plug and
      enough length of cord to reach from the computer's line out/headphone out
      to the scope.
 * A knife, scissors, wire stripping tool, etc. Anything to take insulation off
      the audio cable.

Chop off the audio cable so you have a headphone plug you can connect to
your computer, and enough wire to easily reach your scope. Note the wire colors.
There will be 3-4 wires. Right is usually red, left usually green or white.
Ground is usually either black or uninsulated. If your wires are colored but
not insulated, they're enameled -- remove the enamel with fine sandpaper, a
flame, or carefully with a knife.

Locate the vertical and horizontal inputs on your scope. Connect the left
wire to vertical and right to horizontal. You might have to strip or split 6
inches of cable to make it reach the 2 inputs.

If you don't know which one is right or left, it doesn't matter. The
software can handle it so long as you have one channel attached to vertical and
one attached to horizontal. Polarity of each channel doesn't matter either.
(Press the "M" key on the game's title screen to cycle through all (8) possible
 permutations of backward left, backward right, and switched left and right.)

Now you have 1 or 2 ground wires left. Connect them to the scope's ground
terminals. There's most likely a ground terminal next to each input. If you
only have 1 ground wire (as with many headphones), connect it to one terminal.
It might help to run a separate wire between the ground terminals if you only
have one ground wire.

Make sure your wires are screwed down tight. If you like, you can now
connect an iPod or other audio source to the headphone plug and play some music
through it. In normal mode, the scope should show one channel of the sound. If
you set it to external horizontal drive, you should see an interesting blob
pulsing and wiggling to the music.

Plug the headphone plug into the computer's line out or headphone jack.
Make sure your computer is set to play sound to that jack, plug the cable in
and turn the volume to the max. Now launch asteroids-scope.

If you like, use a splitter to connect speakers so you can hear the picture. :)
However, noises in the room might then affect the picture, since speakers also
act as microphones, and splitters don't stop signals from going the other way.


PRE-COMPILED BINARIES
=====================

This package includes binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac, plus source code.

Windows binaries: Run one of the .exe files in the bin-windows folder. Note that
under Windows you won't see any console messages. They'll be written to a file
named stdout.txt.

Mac binaries: Mount bin-mac-intel.dmg and its contents will open. The .app files
will run without any additional software, and have been tested on a fresh
install of Mac OS X 10.7 Lion. The downside is that console output is hidden.
The raw UNIX executables open a Terminal window, but require SDL to be
installed. You can get SDL from libsdl.org, or right-click one of the .app
packages, "Show Package Contents", browse to Contents/Frameworks, and drag
the SDL.framework folder into /Library/Frameworks in Macintosh HD.
(The Mac binaries are Universal Intel Binaries. They will run on any Intel Mac.
PPC isn't supported because I can't properly compile for PPC on Snow Leopard.)

Linux (Intel 32-bit) binaries: You need SDL (libsdl) installed, but it comes
pre-installed on many modern Linux distros, like Ubuntu. You might need to
chmod +x them before they'll run. That is, open a terminal window and type
chmod, a space, +x, another space, then drag asteroids-scope or asteroids-
window onto the terminal, and then hit enter.


BUILDING FROM SOURCE
====================

Requirements, Windows:

 * MinGW installed
 * libsdl development files for MinGW installed. Download from libsdl.org and
      unpack in C:\MinGW or wherever your MinGW root is.
 * SDL.dll. You can get this from the bin directory of the libsdl dev package
      for MinGW. Copy it into the src dir of this package.

Build from a MinGW prompt, not plain cmd.exe. Otherwise you won't have all the
UNIX utilities needed. Navigate to the src directory and run "make".

Requirements, Linux:

 * build-essential (Debian/Ubuntu/etc.; you need make and gcc)
 * libsdl1.2-dev (or however you get the SDL dev files on your distro)

Go to the src directory and run make.

Requirements, Mac:

 * XCode. You won't be using XCode itself, but it brings in all the Mac OS X
      development utilities.
 * The MacPorts or Fink version of SDL. For MacPorts, "sudo port install libsdl"
      should do it. I built and tested with MacPorts, not Fink.
     (The libsdl.org one WILL NOT work. It only works if you do everything in
      XCode, which I don't because I want my stuff to be cross-platform.)

Go to the src directory and run make. If you want pretty Mac .app packages
instead of UNIX executables that run in Terminal, make macapps. Also note that
the makefile includes a target to make Mac redistributables -- .app packages
with universal binaries and built-in SDL.framework. See makefile comment.

[UPDATE March 24, 2012]
-----------------------

Reuploading due to MediaFire file deletion. Switching licensing to WTFPL. It
said public domain before. I'm switching because of varied definations of
"public domain" around the world. This way should be a little clearer:
Anybody can do whatever they want with this code. No restrictions at all.

[UPDATE May 30, 2015]
---------------------

Reuploading due to the server it was on going down. Only change is I'm putting
it on Github now, so the readme has been reformatted to Markdown.
